Top row: Selected frames from a raw input sequence produced by the [FIM setup](https://www.uni-muenster.de/PRIA/en/FIM/).  
Bottom row: Tracking result obtained by using the proposed method.


Dependencies:  
OpenCV3 (modify the paths in the .pro file)  
QT5+QT Creator, since the application was built with qmake

An example of the application's usage will shortly be added to this [repository's wiki](https://github.com/Ungetym/Drosophila_Tracker/wiki).
